        <p>
          Creating this website was an experience. It was a truly knowledge gaining, exciting, tiresome, and skill improving journey. 
          The desire that I had for this website was to turn it into a piece of art that represented me as an individual.
          I put a lot of thought into every detail of every page from the miniscule details like the name of my website making use of alliteration to the big aspects like the pink flower themed bacakgrounds.
          The goal that I wanted to achieve by using the flower themed backgrounds, the pink and gold colours, and the logo of a woman holding flowers was to display a soft, kind and pretty feminine character. 
          I personally love all things beautiful, romantic and soft like flowers, books, the colour pink, warm cups of coffee on an icy cold winter night sitting by the fire. Intrigued by majestic scenery like paris at night or Lake Como of Italy. I would hope that my website therefore conveys my love for all things majestic and beautiful. 
          May this website bring you a serene, peaceful and blissful journey as you traverse through it dear user.

              My name is Kiara Mohun and I am a digital artist at the University of the WitsWatersRand.
              My passion for art and creating started at a young age. It was a hobby for me that i greatly enjoyed. I continued my creative journey going into high school by choosing visual arts as a subject that I took all the way through to matric. 
              I was adventurous and decided to add design to the mix for a few months. 
              Finally I am at the point in my journey where I am studying digital arts.
               I chose this degree because I believed that it would give me the freedom 
               and opportunity to let my imagination run wild. It has been a very 
               fulfilling journey so far as it has been satisfying my hunger for 
               creativity and artistic expression.
