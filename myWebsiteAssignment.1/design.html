        Goal alignment for my website:<br />
        My goal for this website is to efficiently convey to the users more
        about me as this is a profile website and its main purpose is for the
        users to get to know who you are and what you are about. However, I do
        not want to make it just factual and boring for the user and for myself.
        I want the user to be able to engage with my website and feel more
        connected to it through their experience of it but I want them to at the
        end of their journey know more about me and my website. Regarding this
        website the target audience/user would be people who want to get to know
        more about you either because you are starting a new business, or they
        are looking for people to hire. A website like this one is more about
        giving a good first impression so that the user may take away the type
        of character you have as well as the skills and passion you possess. the
        content of my website is information about me as well as the work that I
        have done. It is a portfolio that represents me.

        Notes on my visual aesthetic: The big idea that I have for my visual
        aesthetic is a feminine, soft, and romantic one. I would like my visual
        aesthetic to encapsulate the beauty of all things feminine. However,
        these design aspects will also be a representation of me. Hence why I am
        going for pastel pinks, white, gold, and may be cream as well for the
        colour palette of my website. I also have this engraved image in my mind
        of adding some sort of design aspect that will make use of flower line
        drawings. There is something so simple yet so elegant about line
        drawings especially of flowers. In my opinion the comparison between the
        feminine and flowers is an accurate one at that. Each flower is
        different and unique just as each woman is too. There is huge symbolism
        and meaning behind the visual design choices I am thinking of
        incorporating into my website. This can make a website special and
        interesting when there is meaning associated with every little detail
        that goes into creating it. For the name of my website, I want it to be
        something quirky and weird in a good way. A name that will stick with
        the user because it is different and original. I am therefore thinking
        of creating a name that contains alliteration or some form of a figure
        of speech. I might also add a logo that displays in its entirety what I
        am trying to convey with the visual aesthetic of my website. It might be
        a figure of a woman or a bouquet of flowers.

        My goal is to achieve a pretty, soft and feminine aesthetic that conveys
        a little bit about me as a person.

      <p>
        The visual design elements that I decided to choose are the floral line
        <br />
        drawings with hints of pink and white as the backgrounds for every
        page.<br />
        I included the woman holding flowers as my logo as it encapsulates the
        whole goal behind my website.
